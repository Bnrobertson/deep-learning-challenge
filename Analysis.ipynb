    "# Deep Learning Overview of the Analysis:\n",
    "The purpose of this analysis is to develop a deep learning model to predict the success of charitable \n",
    "donations for Alphabet Soup. By analyzing historical data on previous donations and their outcomes, \n",
    "I aimed to create a predictive model that can help the organization allocate its resources more effectively \n",

    "# Results:\n",
    "### Data Processing\n",
    "- Target Variable\n",
    "The target variable for our model is IS_SUCCESSFUL, which indicates whether a donation was successful.\n",
    "- Removed Variables\n",
    "The columns EIN and NAME were removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features and do not contribute to the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model\n",
    "#### Neurons:\n",
    "- First hidden layer: 80 neurons\n",
    "- Second hidden layer: 30 neurons\n",
    "#### Layers: \n",
    "The model consists of two hidden layers and one output layer.\n",
    "#### Activation Functions:\n",
    "- Hidden layers: ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function\n",
    "- Output layer: Sigmoid activation function\n",
    "### Reasoning:\n",
    "- The ReLU activation function is commonly used in hidden layers due to its ability to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem and accelerate training.\n",
    "- The Sigmoid activation function is used in the output layer for binary classification tasks as it outputs a probability value between 0 and 1.\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "This project demonstrates the process of developing a deep learning model to predict the success of charity donations using historical data. Through data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation, I aimed to optimize the model's performance and achieve a high accuracy in predicting successful donations. This model can potentially assist Alphabet Soup in making data-driven decisions for better resource allocation and donation management\n"
